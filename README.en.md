# vllm-ascend-workspace

**[中文](README.md)** | **English**

An Agent-only workspace for developing [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [vLLM Ascend](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend). People express goals and make substantive choices; the Agent edits code, prepares environments, runs experiments and reports evidence.

## Start with a task

Open this checkout in an Agent client and describe the task:

> Review this PR for error handling and compatibility.

> Use the existing container `repro-case` on the specified host, with code in `/work/vllm`, and reproduce the issue using `/work/start-case.sh`.

PR review uses native Git and file tools. Existing-container work passes host, container, cwd and the original command directly to remote-dev, preserving that code and environment. Neither task needs a mode binding, source sync, managed execution, knowledge preparation or GitHub identity setup. Knowledge is optional reference. See [remote-dev consumption](docs/remote-dev-consumption.md) for examples and explicit limitations.

When you need the complete development configuration, ask:

> Initialize this workspace for vLLM Ascend development.

Initialization reuses configuration, installs locked packages and runs `vaws_client_setup.py --client all --apply` to detect and configure installed Agent clients together. Invoking a Skill is optional. The result identifies supported native defaults and any remaining native choices, which can be completed once through client tools or computer use. Configured Worktree sessions create directories and run setup before Agent work; Local and resumed sessions retain their directories. Ordinary sessions need no VAWS launcher command. Versions and real acceptance boundaries are in [native client acceptance](docs/native-client-validation-2026-09-12.md) and [native workspace isolation](docs/native-workspace-isolation.md). Installation and platform behavior are in [dependency-plane.md](docs/dependency-plane.md) and [platform-contract.md](docs/platform-contract.md).

For daily work, describe the outcome and the inputs that matter:

- Start a four-card inference service with these model weights and engine options.
- Compare throughput between these baseline and candidate worktrees.
- Collect a profile for this workload and identify the slow operators.
- Locate the first stage where graph and eager outputs diverge.
- Start the local fleet dashboard.

The Agent selects the relevant tool or skill. Tools generate execution references, state transitions and reports from actual results. Missing evidence remains unknown or inconclusive.

## Ownership and design

[The nine design principles](docs/design-principles.md) govern subsequent changes:

- Agent consumption is the design target for every code and command entry.
- Deterministic failures belong in component code and regression tests. Useful lessons may be saved as ordinary Markdown with their conditions, evidence and uncertainty. Knowledge is optional reference; lookup and capture add no required task steps.
- Each runtime owner handles its own lifecycle, validation and records. Business calls accept business inputs and evidence.
- Simplification is measured across the whole task. Unreleased APIs may change directly; retired interfaces have no compatibility aliases.

The workspace owns project materials, client wiring and business skills. `remote-dev` owns explicit endpoint I/O; `vaws-coordinator` owns managed sources, environments, NPUs and execution; `vaws-knowledge` owns Markdown lookup and capture; `vaws-top` owns fleet observation. Observation does not allocate devices. Native attachments establish task identity. Existing containers and unrelated worktrees are preserved.

| **vllm-ascend-benchmark** | Run `vllm bench serve` performance benchmarks on a remote container, with multi-run warmup and statistical aggregation | When measuring throughput/latency; use performance-regression for code comparisons |
| **ascend-memory-profiling** | Profile and attribute HBM memory usage on Ascend NPU, with per-component breakdown and evidence chains | When you need to analyze memory consumption of a vLLM serving workload |
| **ascend-profiling-collection** | Collect Ascend torch-profiler data: start service, bracket profile window, run workload, remote analyse, and write a manifest | When you need kernel_details/trace_view captures |
| **ascend-profiling-analysis** | Analyze collected profiler roots/manifests and generate step/layer/operator/cross-rank reports | When you need to analyze profiling output |
| **vllm-ascend-graph-debug** | Diagnose graph compile, capture, replay, and graph/eager correctness divergence | When graph mode fails or diverges from eager mode |

| **ascend-tensor-dump** | Capture bounded intermediate tensor dumps and locate the first divergent stage, in eager or graph mode | When output is wrong or two configurations disagree and the divergence must be localized |
| **ascend-operator-debug** | Reduce a model failure to one operator and run an explicit input/mode matrix | When building an isolated operator reproducer |

Skill selection follows the task. Detailed inputs and procedures live beside the relevant `SKILL.md`; ordinary local files and Git use native tools. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the client entry and [the documentation index](docs/README.md) separates current contracts from dated evidence.

## Repository and local state

The canonical repository is `vllm-ascend-workspace/vllm-ascend-workspace`. Git submodules `vllm/` and `vllm-ascend/` remain on their community upstreams. First-use identity confirmation applies to requested setup or a managed operation that actually needs a missing personal-container identity. Ordinary review and explicit remote I/O do not trigger it. Personal forks are development remotes; setup preserves established remote choices.

`.agents/skills/` contains business skills, `.agents/lib/` contains shared consumer code, and `.agents/scripts/` contains client wiring and maintenance tools. Client projections route to canonical skills. Runtime state and private configuration stay under untracked `.vaws-local/`; credentials are never committed. Public knowledge uses only package-prepared redacted copies.

The workspace license is independent of the submodules, which retain their upstream licenses.
